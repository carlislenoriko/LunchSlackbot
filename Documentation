Minimum Viable Product - command line requests that search Yelp for restaurant recommendations in a large general area, returns first 3 search results (returns searched cuisine, restaurant name, address, price range)
- next: search specific neighborhoods/street addresses (whatever is possible with Yelp API)
- then: put into Slack as a Slackbot
- later: different interactions with Slackbot (build in Slack? Python?) such as "I don't know what I want to eat, give me inspiration!"

Stretch goals:
- Option for recommendations based on the weather
- Option for recommendations based on the Doomsday Clock
